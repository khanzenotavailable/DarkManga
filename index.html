        <h2>The roots of the wide-eyed look</h2>
        <div style="max-width:1024px; word-wrap:break-word;"><p>The iconic wide-eyed appearance, often linked with manga, traces its origins to the illustrations found in shōjo magazines published from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, as seen in publications like (for example, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shōjo_Gahō>Shōjo Gahō</a>). The most popular illustrators associated with this style at the time were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumeji_Takehisa>Yumeji Takehisa</a> and <a href=https://japanesekawaiiculture.com/nakahara-junichi-and-the-elevation-of-girl-culture>Jun'ichi Nakahara,</a> who, influenced by his work as a doll creator, frequently drew female characters with <b>big eyes</b> in the early 20th century. This had a significant influence on early manga, particularly <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shōjo_manga>shōjo</a>, influencing the works of renowned manga artists <a href=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2022-09-09/the-pioneer-of-shojo-style-macoto-takahashi/.189181>Macoto Takahashi</a> (who is in his mid 80s now, and used to also write manga) and <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/480374.Riyoko_Ikeda>Riyoko Ikeda</a> (who majored in philosophy, is also a singer and a bookwriter).</p></div>
<h1><q><span id="homeQuote">Dark, Bizarre, horror Manga all-in-one, <br>is how we can describe the theme of this site, that has snippets of Manga origin.</span></q></h1>
    <p>Why is Manga characterized by <b>large eyes?</b><br>Manga artists cleverly leverage this element to enhance the charm of their protagonists. The enduring presence of large eyes in manga and anime culture traces back to the 1960s, when Osamu Tezuka, inspired by American Disney cartoons, boldly adopted this distinctive style in his illustrations, forever altering the landscape of <b>Japanese visual storytelling.</b></p>
